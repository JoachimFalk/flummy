# SystemC-VPC library

This repository provides the SystemC-VPC library used by SysteMoC for architecture modeling.

SysteMoC and Virtual Processing Components (VPCs) are the two modeling approaches used by SystemCoDesigner for Design Space Exploration (DSE).
SysteMoC allows for functional modeling and simulation, while Virtual Processing Components (VPCs) allow for architecture modeling and simulation.
Together, the SysteMoC and SystemC-VPC libraries allow for combined functional and performance simulation.
Both SysteMoC and SystemC-VPC are implemented as individual libraries on top of SystemC.
