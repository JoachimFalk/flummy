\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have implemented a framework which \emph{seperates actor functionality} and \emph{communication behavior}.
The communication behavior is \emph{machine extractable} from the executable specification.
As a result, the SystemC library named \SysteMoC{} was developed which provides the basis for representing executable specifications for a model-based design flow.
Currently we use SysteMoC to model an industrial relevant application, to develop a model-based design flow for system exploration.
