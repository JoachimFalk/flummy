Dynamically Loaded C++ Plugins for all platforms</H1>

<P>
<HR>All the source code in this package is released for no charge into
the community. You may do whatever you want with it, except limit
its distribution.

<P>You can download the source package <A HREF="dynload.tar.gz">here</A>

- OVERVIEW -</H2></CENTER>
Dynamically extend a c++ program with new subclasses after the program has been
compiled.  On unix systems this takes advantage of ELF file format and shared
libraries (.so); on Windows regular DLLs are used.  A simple, common API allows
developers to write once for all platforms (a compile is required on each
destination platform, however).
	
<P>This was originally a demonstration of ELF capabilities, and the architecture
is exactly what Jeff Koftinoff provides at <a 
href="http://www.jdkoftinoff.com/linux1.html">http://www.jdkoftinoff.com/linux1.html</a>
To this I have added conditional compilation for Windows (using the Windows DLL API) and
redone the Makefile to compile on Solaris as well as Linux (hopefully some other Unixes
as well - though I haven't access to any other flavours).
	
<P>Take a look at dll.h and plugin.h. This stuff is really quite straightforward.
<CENTER>
<H2>
- COMPILING AND RUNNING -</H2></CENTER>
To compile, edit the <b>Makefile.config</b> and follow the instructions contained within
to select your platform.  Then run:

<ul>
<li><b>make</b> on Linux and possibly most other Unixes
<li><b>gmake</b> on Solaris
<li><b>make</b> on Windows either under Cygwin or using GNU make.  Do not attempt to
use MSVC++'s nmake (this requires a different Makefile format).
</ul>

It will make the executable "plugtest" as well as the two plug in libraries "PlugInFun.so"
 and "PlugInHappy.so" (or PlugInFun.dll and PlugInHappy.dll on Windows)

<P>To run the test program, type "./plugtest"

<P>It will ask you for a name of a dll. You may give the full path name
of one of the previously made plug in libraires. If you want, you can
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
This will allow you to enter in the file name of the plug in library you
want without the full path name. Probably it is best to give the full path
name or put your plugins in a special place.

<P>Once you give it a valid name, it will attempt to open that library
file and create an object from the class defined within. It will then call
the Show() method of that object, and then will display the C++ RTTI typeid
name. After all this it will destroy all the objects created.

- GUIDELINES -</H2></CENTER>
The key for this whole system to work is to:
<UL>
<LI>
Have good abstract base classes/factory classes in your application for
the libraries to inherit from</LI>

<LI>
compile everything with "-fPIC"</LI>

<LI>
link the executable with the "-rdynamic" flag and the dl library</LI>

<LI>
create the shared libraries with the "-shared" flag</LI>

<LI>
be wary of RTTI and exception handling - newer versions of compilers may
do internal things differently and cause big problems if you compile your
application with one version and the shared libraries with another.</LI>

<LI>
Solaris users - see <a href="http://realm.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~subtle/solaris28_link.html">
this page</a> which describes the necessity of the -mimpure-text flag (basically,
it does not link without it).
